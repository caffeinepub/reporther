      "featureTitle": "Fix the incident evidence upload flow so uploaded evidence is actually persisted in the backend and appears in the Police Report submission dialog as selectable attachments. Specifically: (1) update `frontend/src/components/IncidentForm.tsx` so `uploadFile()` calls the existing React Query mutation `useSaveEvidenceFile()` (which calls backend `uploadEvidence`) instead of generating a fake evidenceId; (2) stop calling `useLinkEvidenceToIncident()` as a no-op for linking and treat backend `uploadEvidence(incidentId, ...)` as the source of truth for linking; (3) ensure the incident evidence React Query cache is invalidated/refetched after each successful upload so `IncidentDetail` and `PoliceReportDialog` receive a non-empty `availableEvidence` when evidence exists.",
